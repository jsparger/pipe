A framework for building modular data analysis pipelines.

Please check the develop branch if the master is empty.

This project is currently being migrated to GitHub from a private repository. When migration and source code documentation are completed, examples and a wiki will be added. After these tasks are complete, development will begin in this repository. While far from perfect, the complete code is quite functional; it is currently being used in Nuclear Engineering research projects at a major university. 

If you have come upon this project while this notice is still present, please check back very soon!
